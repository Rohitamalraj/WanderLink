## 🚀 Complete Flow

```
TWO USERS INPUT
├─ User 1: 1000 HBAR @ "New York"
└─ User 2: 500 HBAR @ "London"
    ↓
TOTAL POOL: 1500 HBAR
    ↓
AGENT NEGOTIATION (A2A Messages)
├─ Validator: "1500 is high, suggest 1050 HBAR"
├─ Coordinator: "Counter-offer 1275 HBAR"
└─ Validator: "Accepted 1275 HBAR"
    ↓
SMART CONTRACT EXECUTION
├─ Create pool in contract
├─ Lock 1275 HBAR in escrow
└─ Set location requirements
    ↓
AGENTS STAKE ON BEHALF
├─ User 1 share: (1000/1500) * 1275 = 850 HBAR
└─ User 2 share: (500/1500) * 1275 = 425 HBAR
    ↓
LOCATION VERIFICATION
├─ User 1 proves: "New York" ✓
└─ User 2 proves: "London" ✓
    ↓
FUNDS RELEASED

## 📝 Smart Contract Details

### Contract Address
After deployment: `0.0.YOUR_CONTRACT_ID`

### Key Functions

```solidity
// Create multi-user pool
function createPool(
    bytes32 poolId,
    address[] participants,
    uint256[] amounts,
    string[] locations
) external payable

// Update after negotiation
function updateNegotiatedAmount(
    bytes32 poolId,
    uint256 negotiatedAmount
) external onlyValidator

// Verify user location
function verifyLocation(
    bytes32 poolId,
    address user,
    string location
) external onlyValidator

function releaseFunds(
    bytes32 poolId,
    address user
) external
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### Step 1: Deploy Contract

```bash
# Compile Solidity
cd contracts
solc --bin --abi StakingEscrow.sol -o build/

# Deploy to Hedera
npm run deploy:contract

# Save contract ID to .env
CONTRACT_ID=0.0.12345678
```

### Step 2: Test Multi-User Staking

```bash
# Start application
npm run dev

# Call multi-user API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/multi-stake \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "users": [
      {
        "accountId": "0.0.11111",
        "amount": 1000,
        "location": "New York"
      },
      {
        "accountId": "0.0.22222",
        "amount": 500,
        "location": "London"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Step 3: Watch Agent Negotiation

```
Console Output:

💰 Multi-User Staking Pool:
   Users: 2
   Total Amount: 1500 HBAR
   User 1: 1000 HBAR @ New York
   User 2: 500 HBAR @ London

📤 Step 1: Coordinator initiating pool stake request...
📥 Step 2: Validator processing and negotiating...

🤝 Negotiation Round 1:
   Original: 1500 HBAR
   Proposed: 1050 HBAR
   Reason: Risk mitigation

🤝 Negotiation Round 2:
   Counter-offer: 1275 HBAR

✅ Negotiation Complete:
   Requested: 1500 HBAR
   Negotiated: 1275 HBAR

📝 Step 4: Creating pool in smart contract...
   ✅ Pool created: pool_1234567890
```

### Step 4: Verify Locations & Release

```typescript
// After users verify their locations
const contractEscrow = new ContractEscrowService(client, contractId);

// Verify User 1
await contractEscrow.verifyLocation('pool_001', '0.0.11111', 'New York');

// Verify User 2
await contractEscrow.verifyLocation('pool_001', '0.0.22222', 'London');

// Release to User 1 (gets 850 HBAR)
await contractEscrow.releaseFunds('pool_001', '0.0.11111');

// Release to User 2 (gets 425 HBAR)
await contractEscrow.releaseFunds('pool_001', '0.0.22222');

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Proportional Distribution
- User 1 contributed 66.67% → Gets 66.67% of negotiated amount
- User 2 contributed 33.33% → Gets 33.33% of negotiated amount

### 2. Individual Location Verification
- Each user must verify their own location
- Can't withdraw until verified
- Independent verification per user

### 3. Smart Contract Security
- Funds locked on-chain
- Only validator can verify locations
- Only users can withdraw their own funds
- Re-entrancy protection

### 4. Agent Negotiation
- AI analyzes total pool amount
- Suggests safer amount if needed
- Multi-round negotiation
- All via A2A messages on HCS

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Equal Split

```json
{
  "users": [
    { "accountId": "0.0.11111", "amount": 500, "location": "Tokyo" },
    { "accountId": "0.0.22222", "amount": 500, "location": "Paris" }
  ]
}
```

**Result:**
- Total: 1000 HBAR
- Negotiated: ~850 HBAR (if validator suggests lower)
- Each gets: 425 HBAR (50/50 split)

### Scenario 2: Unequal Split

```json
{
  "users": [
    { "accountId": "0.0.11111", "amount": 800, "location": "Berlin" },
    { "accountId": "0.0.22222", "amount": 200, "location": "Sydney" }
  ]
}
```

**Result:**
- Total: 1000 HBAR
- Negotiated: ~850 HBAR
- User 1 gets: 680 HBAR (80%)
- User 2 gets: 170 HBAR (20%)

### Scenario 3: Three Users

```json
{
  "users": [
    { "accountId": "0.0.11111", "amount": 500, "location": "NYC" },
    { "accountId": "0.0.22222", "amount": 300, "location": "LA" },
    { "accountId": "0.0.33333", "amount": 200, "location": "Chicago" }
  ]

- Negotiated: ~850 HBAR
- User 1: 425 HBAR (50%)
- User 2: 255 HBAR (30%)
- User 3: 170 HBAR (20%)
