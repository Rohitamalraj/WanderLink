### **Step-by-Step:**

**1. Make sure server is running:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**2. Open Browser 1 (Chrome):**
```
http://localhost:3000/simple-stake
Connect wallet
Enter: Rohit, $2300, Goa
Click "Join Pool"
See: "Waiting 1/3"
```

**3. Open Browser 2 (Firefox or Chrome Incognito):**
```
http://localhost:3000/simple-stake
Connect wallet (different wallet!)
Enter: Yuvan, $700, Goa
Click "Join Pool"
See: "Waiting 2/3"
```

**4. Open Browser 3 (Edge or another Incognito):**
```
http://localhost:3000/simple-stake
Connect wallet (different wallet!)
Enter: Azar, $1200, Goa
Click "Join Pool"
See: "AI Negotiating..." ü§ñ
```

## Common Issues

### **Issue 1: Pool shows 3/3 but won't negotiate**

**Solution:**
```
1. Click "Reset Pool"
2. Refresh ALL browsers
3. Join again
```

### **Issue 2: Error appears in 2 browsers but not the first**

**Cause:** Race condition during auto-negotiation

**Solution:**
```
1. Don't click "Reset Pool" while negotiating
2. Wait for negotiation to complete OR
3. Reset and refresh ALL browsers
```

### **Issue 3: Negotiation takes too long**

**Cause:** AI agents are slow (normal)

**Solution:**
```
Wait 15-20 seconds
If still stuck after 30 seconds:
1. Check terminal for errors
2. Reset pool
3. Try again
```

### **Issue 4: Can't connect wallet in multiple browsers**

**Solution:**
```
Use different browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Chrome Incognito
- Firefox Private

Each needs different MetaMask wallet!
```

## Expected Behavior

### **Timeline:**
```
0:00 - Browser 1 joins (1/3)
0:10 - Browser 2 joins (2/3)
0:20 - Browser 3 joins (3/3)
0:21 - "AI Negotiating..." appears
0:35 - Negotiation complete!
0:36 - All browsers show result
‚úÖ Success!
```

### **What You Should See:**

**All 3 browsers:**
```
‚úÖ AI Negotiation Complete!

Agreed Budget: $1400
Your Stake: $70 (‚âà 1,400 HBAR)

AI Reasoning: "After AI negotiation, we've agreed 
on a trip budget of $1400 with a 5% stake ($70 per 
person = 1400.00 HBAR). This ensures fair commitment 
from all 3 participants. Total pool: $210."

[Stake 1,400 HBAR]
```

## Success! üéâ

If you see the negotiation result in all 3 browsers, you're done!

Click "Stake X HBAR" in each browser to complete the flow.
