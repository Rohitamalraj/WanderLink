## 🎮 How to Test

### Test 1: High Amount (Triggers Negotiation)

```bash
# In the UI:
Amount: 1000
Location: New York

# Expected Result:
✅ Validator suggests ~700 HBAR
✅ Coordinator counters with ~850 HBAR
✅ Final: 850 HBAR staked in escrow
```

### Test 2: Reasonable Amount (Direct Approval)

```bash
Amount: 300
Location: Los Angeles

# Expected Result:
✅ Validator approves immediately
✅ No negotiation needed
✅ Final: 300 HBAR staked in escrow
```

### Test 3: Very High Amount (Multiple Rounds)

```bash
Amount: 5000
Location: London

# Expected Result:
✅ Round 1: Validator suggests 3500
✅ Round 2: Coordinator counters 4250
✅ Round 3: Validator accepts
✅ Final: 4250 HBAR staked
```

## 🔧 Key Features

### Negotiation Algorithm

**Validator Strategy:**
- < 100 HBAR → Approve immediately
- 100-500 HBAR → Approve with monitoring
- 500-1000 HBAR → Suggest 70-80%
- \> 1000 HBAR → Suggest 60-70%

**Coordinator Strategy:**
- Round 1 → Counter with middle ground
- Round 2 → Accept if within 20%
- Round 3 → Accept validator's offer

### Escrow Protection

```typescript
// Create escrow account
const escrow = await escrowService.createEscrowAccount();

// Lock funds
await escrowService.lockFunds(userAccount, negotiatedAmount);

// Release after verification
await escrowService.releaseFunds(userAccount, negotiatedAmount);
```

### Location Verification

```typescript
// Verify location
const verification = await locationService.verifyLocation(
  "New York",  // Required
  "New York"   // User provided
);

if (verification.isMatch) {
  await releaseFunds();
}
```
