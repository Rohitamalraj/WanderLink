## 🐛 If You Don't See Join Logs

### **Problem: No "=== Join Pool Request ===" logs**

**This means:** The join request isn't reaching the server

**Possible causes:**
1. Browser error (check browser console)
2. Network issue
3. Wrong endpoint

**Solution:**
```
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Check Network tab
4. Share any errors you see
```

### **Problem: See join logs but participants = 0 later**

**This means:** Server restarted or pool was reset

**Solution:**
```
1. Don't save any files during test
2. Don't click "Reset Pool" during test
3. Complete all 3 joins quickly (within 30 seconds)
```

## 📊 What to Share

If it's still not working, share:

1. **Terminal output** from when you join
2. **Browser console errors** (F12 → Console tab)
3. **Network errors** (F12 → Network tab → look for red items)
