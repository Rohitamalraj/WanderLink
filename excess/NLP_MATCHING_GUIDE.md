# 🎯 NLP-Based Trip Matching - Implementation Guide

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## 🌟 What Changed

### **Before: Form-Based**
- Users filled a 4-step form
- 18 structured fields (name, email, destinations, budget, interests, etc.)
- Rigid, time-consuming process

### **After: Natural Language**
- Users describe their trip in natural language
- Simple, conversational interface
- AI extracts structured data automatically

---

## 💬 How It Works

### **1. User Input (Natural Language)**
Instead of filling forms, users just type something like:

```
"Hi! I want a relaxing beach vacation in Goa for 4 days with a 
budget of around $500. I'm traveling with a friend, and we love 
sunbathing, trying local seafood, and short boat rides."
```

### **2. AI Processing (NLP Parsing)**
The Agent Service automatically extracts:
- **Destination**: Goa
- **Duration**: 4 days
- **Budget**: $300-$800 (flexible range around $500)
- **Travel Type**: Relaxing beach vacation
- **Group Type**: Friends
- **Interests**: Beach, Food, Adventure
- **Pace**: Relaxed

### **3. Intelligent Matching**
- Queries database for available travel groups
- Calculates compatibility using extracted preferences
- Returns personalized matches

### **4. Results**
Users see:
- Matched groups with compatibility scores
- Why they match (shared interests, budget, destination)
- Original NLP insights shown

## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### **New Endpoint**: `/api/find-matches-nlp`

**Location**: `agents/src/agent_service.py`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_1234...",
  "nlpInput": "Hi! I want a relaxing beach vacation in Goa...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-22T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "trip_id": "trip_001",
      "compatibility_score": 87.5,
      "trip": {
        "title": "Goa Beach Getaway",
        "destination": "Goa",
        ...
      },
      "compatibility": {
        "destination": 1.0,
        "budget": 0.95,
        "interests": 0.85,
        "pace": 0.90
      },
      "reasoning": "Destination match, Budget compatible, Shared interests",
      "nlp_insights": {
        "original_input": "Hi! I want a relaxing beach vacation...",
        "extracted_destination": ["Goa"],
        "extracted_budget": "$300-$800",
        "extracted_interests": ["Beach", "Food", "Adventure"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "total": 1,
  "parsed_preferences": {
    "destinations": ["Goa"],
    "budgetMin": 300,
    "budgetMax": 800,
    "interests": ["Beach", "Food", "Adventure"],
    "travelPace": "relaxed",
    "duration": 4,
    "groupType": "Friends"
  }
}
```

## 🧠 NLP Parsing Logic

### **`parse_nlp_to_preferences()` Function**

**Extracts**:

1. **Destinations**:
   - Searches for common destination keywords
   - Supported: Tokyo, Goa, Bali, Paris, London, Iceland, Thailand, Morocco, etc.
   - Default: "Any" if none found

2. **Budget**:
   - Regex pattern: `$500`, `$1000-$1500`, `500 to 1000`
   - Creates flexible range (±$200-300)
   - Default: $500-$3000

3. **Interests/Activities**:
   - Keyword mapping:
     - sunbathing/beach → Beach
     - seafood/food/cuisine → Food
     - boat/kayak/hiking → Adventure
     - temple/museum → Culture
     - yoga/spa → Wellness
     - photography → Photography
   - Multiple interests detected

4. **Travel Pace**:
   - "relaxing/relax/slow/chill" → Relaxed
   - "packed/busy/active/adventure" → Packed
   - Default → Moderate

5. **Duration**:
   - Pattern: "4 days", "7-day trip"
   - Default: 5 days

6. **Group Type**:
   - "friend/friends" → Friends
   - "solo/alone" → Solo
   - "couple/partner" → Couple
   - "family/kids" → Family
   - Default: Any

7. **Experience Level**:
   - "first time/beginner" → Beginner
   - "experienced/expert" → Expert
   - Default → Intermediate
