```

#### B. Test Find Matches
```bash

  tg.status
FROM group_members gm
JOIN travel_groups tg ON gm.group_id = tg.id
WHERE gm.user_id = 'f7e78b88-682c-4534-af7c-c4332db4c038'
AND tg.name = 'Tokyo Cherry Blossom Adventure';

-- Should show:
-- name: Tokyo Cherry Blossom Adventure
-- current_members: 2 (was 1, now 2 after you joined)
-- status: forming
```

## 🎯 Success Indicators

### ✅ Everything Working If:
- [x] User inserted into `users` table
- [x] 5 test groups created in `travel_groups`
- [x] "CREATE GROUP" button appears
- [x] Modal opens with form
- [x] New group saves successfully
- [x] "FIND MY MATCHES" shows all groups
- [x] "JOIN GROUP" button works
- [x] Group member count increases
- [x] Status changes to 'full' when 3 members reached

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting

#### "Unauthorized" Error
**Fix**: Sign out and sign in again
```bash
1. Go to /auth/signin
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Try creating group again
```

#### "Foreign Key Constraint" Error
**Fix**: User not in users table
```sql
-- Re-run this:
INSERT INTO users (id, email, full_name, avatar_url)
SELECT id, email, 
       raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', 
       raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url'
FROM auth.users
WHERE id = 'f7e78b88-682c-4534-af7c-c4332db4c038'
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

#### No Groups Showing
**Fix**: Check database
```sql
-- Verify groups exist:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM travel_groups WHERE status = 'forming';
-- Should return at least 5

-- Check API endpoint manually:
# Open browser: http://localhost:3000/api/groups?status=forming
# Should return JSON with 5+ groups
```

#### Can't Join Group
**Possible reasons**:
1. Group is full (3/3 members)
2. You already joined
3. You created the group (can't join own group)

**Check**:
```sql
-- See which groups you can join:
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  current_members,
  max_members,
  status,
  creator_id = 'f7e78b88-682c-4534-af7c-c4332db4c038' as is_creator
FROM travel_groups
WHERE status = 'forming' 
AND current_members < max_members
AND creator_id != 'f7e78b88-682c-4534-af7c-c4332db4c038';
```
