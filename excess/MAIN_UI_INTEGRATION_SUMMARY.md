# Main UI Integration Complete! 🎉

## What Was Changed

### `/app/agent-trips-v2/page.tsx`

**Replaced old complex flow with simple working solution:**

### ✅ Key Changes:

1. **Added `useGroupStatus` Hook**
   - Automatic polling every 5 seconds
   - Stops polling once group is found
   - Clean state management

2. **Simplified API Calls**
   - **Before:** Multiple endpoints (`/api/store-user-trip`, `/api/submit-trip`, etc.)
   - **After:** Single endpoint `/api/agent-message` that talks directly to agents

3. **User ID Format**
   - Changed from `user_xxx` to `test_xxx` (matches test-agent format)
   - Stored in `localStorage` as `wanderlink_agent_user_id`

4. **Direct Agent Communication**
   - Message goes directly to Travel Agent
   - Travel Agent → MatchMaker → Planner
   - Planner stores in Supabase
   - Frontend polls and displays automatically

5. **Group Display**
   - Shows itinerary from Supabase
   - Displays group members
   - Real group data from `groupFound` state
