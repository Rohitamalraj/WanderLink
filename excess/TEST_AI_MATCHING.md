# Testing AI-Powered Matching Integration

## ✅ What Was Changed

### 1. **Agent Service (agents/src/agent_service.py)**
- ✅ Added Supabase client initialization
- ✅ Updated `/api/find-matches` endpoint to:
  - Query Supabase for real travel groups
  - Calculate AI-powered compatibility scores
  - Filter groups by availability (current_members < max_members)
  - Return personalized matches (≥60% compatibility only)
- ✅ Implemented `calculate_ai_compatibility()` function with:
  - **Destination Match** (30% weight): Exact or partial matching
  - **Budget Compatibility** (20% weight): Distance-based scoring
  - **Interests Match** (25% weight): Intersection-based scoring
  - **Travel Pace Match** (15% weight): Activity count heuristic
  - **Experience Match** (10% weight): Budget-experience correlation

### 2. **Frontend (frontend/app/trips/page.tsx)**
- ✅ Changed fetch URL from `/api/trips/find-matches` to Agent Service: `${NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_SERVICE_URL}/api/find-matches`
- ✅ Updated request payload to send full user preferences
- ✅ Added environment variable for configurable endpoint

### 3. **Environment Variables**
- ✅ agents/.env already has Supabase credentials
- ✅ frontend/.env.local already has `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000`
- ✅ Installed `supabase` package in agents environment

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Step 1: Start All Services**

Open 3 PowerShell windows:

**Window 1 - Agent Service:**
```powershell
cd D:\WanderLink\agents
python src\agent_service.py
```
✅ Look for: `✅ Supabase client initialized`
✅ Look for: `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000`

**Window 2 - Frontend:**
```powershell
cd D:\WanderLink\frontend
npm run dev
```
✅ Look for: `- Local: http://localhost:3000`

**Window 3 - (Optional) MatchMaker Agent:**
```powershell
cd D:\WanderLink\agents
python src\matchmaker_agent.py
```
*(Not required for basic matching, but good for advanced features)*

---

### **Step 2: Open Frontend**

1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/trips
2. Click **"FIND MY MATCHES"** button
3. Fill out the 4-step form:

**Test Case 1: Tokyo Budget Traveler**
- **Step 1**: Name: "Alex", Email: "alex@test.com"
- **Step 2**: 
  - Destination: Tokyo
  - Budget: $1000 - $1500
  - Travel Pace: Moderate
  - Experience: Intermediate
- **Step 3**: Interests: Culture, Food, Photography
- **Step 4**: (Skip or fill optional)

**Test Case 2: Luxury Beach Lover**
- **Step 1**: Name: "Sam", Email: "sam@test.com"
- **Step 2**:
  - Destination: Bali
  - Budget: $800 - $1200
  - Travel Pace: Relaxed
  - Experience: Beginner
- **Step 3**: Interests: Beach, Wellness, Nature
- **Step 4**: Accommodation: Resort

### **Step 3: Verify AI Matching**

#### **In Frontend Console** (F12 → Console):
```
🔎 Finding matches using AI Agent Service...
📊 AI Match results: {matches: Array(X), total: X}
```

#### **In Agent Service Terminal**:
```
============================================================
📨 Received match request from user: user_1234...
📍 Preferences: ['Tokyo']
💰 Budget: $1000-$1500
============================================================

📊 Found 5 groups in database
✅ 5 groups have available space
✨ Returning 1 compatible matches (≥60%)
   #1: Tokyo Cherry Blossom Adventure - 86.5% compatible
```

---

### **Step 4: Compare Results**

#### **Test Tokyo Preferences:**
Expected high scores for:
- ✅ Tokyo Cherry Blossom Adventure (~85-90%)
- ✅ Thailand Island Hopping (~65-70% - similar budget/interests)

Expected low scores (filtered out <60%):
- ❌ Iceland Northern Lights (different destination, higher budget)
- ❌ Morocco Desert Safari (different vibe)

#### **Test Bali Preferences:**
Expected high scores for:
- ✅ Bali Wellness & Beaches (~90-95% - perfect match!)
- ✅ Thailand Island Hopping (~70-75% - similar beach/relaxed)

Expected low scores:
- ❌ Tokyo Cherry Blossom (~50% - different vibe)
- ❌ Iceland Northern Lights (~40% - opposite climate)

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

### **✅ What SHOULD Happen (Real AI)**
- [x] Agent Service receives request with full user preferences
- [x] Supabase query returns all 5 test groups from database
- [x] AI compatibility calculation runs for each group
- [x] Different users get DIFFERENT compatibility scores
- [x] Scores vary based on destination, budget, and interests
- [x] Only matches ≥60% are returned
- [x] Frontend displays varying scores (not all 75%)

### **❌ What SHOULD NOT Happen Anymore**
- [x] ~~All groups showing 75% compatibility~~
- [x] ~~Hardcoded compatibility breakdown (75/80/70/65)~~
- [x] ~~User preferences ignored~~
- [x] ~~Every user getting identical results~~

## 📊 Example Expected Results

### **Tokyo Budget Traveler** ($1000-$1500, Culture/Food):
```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "trip": {"title": "Tokyo Cherry Blossom Adventure"},
      "compatibility_score": 86.5,
      "compatibility": {
        "destination": 1.0,    // Perfect match
        "budget": 0.92,        // $1200 in range
        "interests": 0.85,     // Culture/Food match

      "compatibility_score": 72.8,
      "compatibility": {
        "destination": 0.7,    // Similar region
        "budget": 0.85,        // $1100 slightly high
        "interests": 0.80,     // Beach match
        "pace": 0.70
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Failed to find matches: Network request failed"**
**Cause**: Agent Service not running
**Fix**: Start Agent Service on port 8000

### **Issue: "No matches found" but database has groups**
**Cause**: All groups have compatibility <60%
**Fix**: This is correct! Try different preferences that better match test data

### **Issue: Agent Service shows "Database not configured"**
**Cause**: Supabase env variables not loaded
**Fix**: 
1. Check `agents/.env` has `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
2. Restart Agent Service

### **Issue: Still seeing hardcoded 75% scores**
**Cause**: Frontend cached or calling old route
**Fix**:
1. Hard refresh frontend (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check console shows "AI Agent Service" message
3. Verify Agent Service terminal shows incoming requests

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **Integration Complete When:**
1. Agent Service logs show incoming match requests
2. Different test users get different compatibility scores
3. Scores accurately reflect preference alignment
4. Tokyo preferences → high score for Tokyo group
5. Bali preferences → high score for Bali group
6. No more universal 75% scores
7. Compatibility breakdown shows real calculated values

## 📝 Next Steps After Verification

Once you confirm AI matching works:

1. **Update COMPLETE_WORKFLOW.md** - Document new AI flow
2. **Update TESTING_GUIDE.md** - Add AI matching verification steps
3. **Consider enhancements**:
   - Connect to MatchMaker Agent for even smarter matching
   - Add date overlap checking
   - Implement semantic similarity for destinations
   - Use OpenAI for NLP-based preference extraction

## 🎉 What You've Achieved

You've successfully connected the frontend to **real AI-powered matching**:
