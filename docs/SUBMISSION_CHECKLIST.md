## üìù Submission Form Answers (Draft)

**What problem does your project solve?**
> Solo travelers want authentic group experiences with strangers, but meeting unknown people and pooling money creates safety, fraud, and accountability risks that Web2 services cannot solve. WanderLink uses blockchain and AI to create a trustless, verifiable, and safe stranger-trip marketplace.

**What makes your project unique?**
> WanderLink is the first platform where AI agents autonomously negotiate optimal travel groups, smart contracts enforce commitment, and multi-layer verification ensures safety ‚Äî all while preserving privacy through encryption. We combine 6 cutting-edge Web3 technologies into one cohesive UX.

**How does your project use [Sponsor Name]?**
> (Customize per sponsor track)

**What's next for your project?**
> Post-hackathon: security audit, mainnet deployment, local partner onboarding, mobile app, insurance integration, DAO governance, and scaling to 10,000+ travelers globally.
