## 🔧 COMPATIBILITY ALGORITHM

The system calculates match scores based on:

**Interests Match (35% weight):**
- Counts common interests between you and trip
- Example: If you have 5 interests and trip has 3 matching = 60%

**Budget Match (30% weight):**
- 100% if trip is within your budget
- Decreases if over budget

**Pace Match (20% weight):**
- 100% if exact match (Relaxed = Relaxed)
- 50% if different

**Destination Match (15% weight):**
- 100% if trip destination is in your preferred list
- 30% otherwise

**Final Score:**
```
(Interests × 0.35) + (Budget × 0.30) + (Pace × 0.20) + (Destination × 0.15) × 100
```

Only trips with **40% or higher** are shown.

## 📊 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

### ✅ What Should Work:

1. **Form Validation:**
   - Can't proceed to Step 2 without completing Step 1
   - Required fields highlighted
   - Progress bar updates

2. **API Calls:**
   - Creates user (POST /api/user)
   - Saves preferences (POST /api/user/preferences)
   - Creates agent (POST /api/user/agent)
   - Finds matches (POST /api/trips/find-matches)

3. **Results Display:**
   - Shows 5 mock trips
   - Each with realistic compatibility scores
   - Expandable details
   - Working action buttons

4. **Database Persistence:**
   - All data saved to Supabase
   - Can refresh page and data persists
   - Can view in Supabase dashboard

### ⚠️ Known Limitations:

1. **Mock Data:**
   - Currently using 5 hardcoded trips
   - Real trip integration coming in Phase 2

2. **Agent Communication:**
   - User agents created but not actively communicating yet
   - Match algorithm runs on backend API
   - Full P2P agent communication in Phase 2

3. **Host Dashboard:**
   - Join requests saved but hosts can't see them yet
   - Host interface coming in Phase 2

4. **Real-time Updates:**
   - No live notifications yet
   - Need to refresh to see updates
   - WebSocket integration in Phase 2
